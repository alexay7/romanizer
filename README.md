# Directory romanizer

I don't know why anyone would need this, but I needed it and so I created this script.

All it does is iterate over a directory and change the names of the subdirectories and files inside of it so that they don't have japanese characters anymore, converting them into romaji.

## How to use

You really only need to change 2 things, the variable ROUTE to indicate the root folder that you want to romanize and the variable MAXDEPTH in case your folder structure is deeper than 1 level.
